Live video game streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube Gaming are experiencing rapid growth, but they face increasing difficulty in maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). This challenge arises from unpredictable network conditions, variations in stream quality, and constantly changing viewer engagement. Traditional QoS techniques are typically static and do not adapt effectively to these dynamic factors in real time. To address this, a data-driven solution is proposed that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize QoS dynamically. The system collects real-time stream metrics such as bitrate, latency, and frame drops, along with viewer feedback in text form. Using a BERT-based sentiment analysis model, the system interprets viewer emotions and engagement levels. These insights, combined with streaming data, are used to train a deep neural network (DNN) that classifies overall viewer satisfaction. Based on this classification and sentiment results, the system can recommend real-time QoS adjustments—such as increasing bitrate or reducing latency—to improve viewer experience. This approach provides a smarter, adaptive method to manage streaming quality using big data analytics and deep learning.
